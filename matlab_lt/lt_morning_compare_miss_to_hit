label songs
change miss label
look at template of miss and hit
find most extreme syllables in missed ones, and use that to make a new template. 
you want to be able to hit the ones that you would have missed before.  so change AND NOT to OR YES logic for the old targets.

look at individual slices for:
1) hits, misses.  divide the latter into those you wanted to miss, andt hos not.  make template from fringe of what you wanted, non-fringe, and those you wanted. 
if labeled both catch and notcatch, combine them by first changing misslables to same
    thing, and then using transfer calls.
then use lt_count, since all labeled songs are now in batch.catch.keep.
