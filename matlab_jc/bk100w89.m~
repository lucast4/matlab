% TEMPLATE HITS ALL A's at first point
    % 1-3 are synshifts of A
    % 4 is a birdtaf NOT off of a note before the downsweep
    % 5 is a birdtaf AND off of the intro note before the A
% looks like decay

% Wait until Saturday dawn to start because by then I will have learned
% things from bk50w18.

% Ready to go...
