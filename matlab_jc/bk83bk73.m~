 % Syntax - if present...very slow
 % Covert - GREAT because 3 notes, and minimal syntax learning
    % A potential 6 experiment MU in LMAN bird
 % 100% done
 % In my CR cage
        
% Claimed by TW 
% Potential syntax bird (also has high stacks for pitch shifting)
% 

% Started screening on 03.08.10
% High stacks (A)

% 03.09.10 - Experiment 1
    % Questionable whether he will learn
    % Hit before A---> assay for increased p(B-C)

    % 3.09 --- Start WN at 9:45am
            % 4:30pm - Doesn't look like much is happening.
            % 7:50pm - WN off - no signs of significant learning
            
% 04.04.10 - Experiment 2 - 100% hit rate with catch trials
    % 04.07 - made template
