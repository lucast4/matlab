% July-August 2010 - microstimulation
    % note that TW had previously done stim with this bird in 2009
% July 23 - baseline
% July 24-28 - stim rig debugging
% July 29 - 10% at baseline to test effect
    % switched leads a couple times but returned to originals
    % made sure all connections were good
    % around 3pm - new connections - set stim rate at 10% (i.e. catch at 90%)
% July 30 - 10% at baseline - looks great - var reduction of nearly 40%
    % 5pm - checked volume for low pass wn - looks good
    % checked threshold for WN - 80% - hit below 7300Hz looking b/t 6000 and 8100
% July 31 - var reduction still looks good
    % 12:06pm - threshold for WN to hit below 7376Hz - 80% for the morning
% August 1 
    % 11am - adjusted templates
    % 12:06pm - threshold for WN to hit below 7480Hz - 80% for the morning
% August 4
    % 7am - 9:45am - wn off because computer restarted
    % 10am - noted that left side stim gave error sign - reconnected wires
        % at the circuit board, which fixed it
    % 5:24pm - wn off for good - because he forgot a bit and was
        % re-learning which would confound interpretation
% August 5
    % 10:15am - left side gave errors.  Handled bird and reinserted but to
        % no avail.  Turned down stim from 90mA to 70mA (needed to go below
        % 80mA to avoid error).
    % 10:45am - stim still looks effective, based on effect on song
    % Aug 5th -  switched stim boxes  - Aug 6th - no errors, but stim
    % doesn't look effective??
% August 6 - 2:58pm - switched back to stim box that gave error signals but
% appeared to work

% August 9 (dawn) - hit below 7400Hz - 80% for the previous day
%                 - stim trig same as WN trig - 0ms delay, 80ms long pulse
%                 - no catch trials for either stim or WN, no threshold for stim
%               - 11:55am - raised to 7445Hz - 80% for the morning
% 7:30pm - robust learning had occurred - thus there was no reason to
    % continue this pilot experiment, but it was necessary to know if the
    % stimulator had been working...so I changed the template to the previous
    % stim configuration but with only 25% catch trials - which allows both testing for
    % reversion/var reduction and ALSO allows for the beginning of a second
    % pilot experiment to test whether this stim configuration blocks
    % subsequent learning...
% August 10 - 10:30am - wn off, reduce stim rate to 20%
%   Stimulator was clearly working, as pre-stim caused big reversion
%   Decided to turn wn off because it would be difficult to interpret block
%   of subsequent learning due to big reversion effect + possible ongoing
%   consolidation.
% 5:08pm - switched Left and Right stim outputs - eliminates error signal
%    
% August 11 - made sure stim boxes were passing current
%   lowered stim current to 50uA to reduce possible damage
% August 12
%   Repeat August 9 experiment - hit below 7400Hz
%   10:45am - arrived - wn error - re-powered stimulator - fixed
%           - but error again w/in 15min
%   11:05am - hit below 7515Hz (80% for morning)
%       back up to 90uA
%   4:58pm - robust learning
%       New folder and changed stim template to hit premotor window
%           65ms delay, 60ms WN
%           50% catch stim
%       WN remains on
%   8:20pm - switch stimulators R vs L - WN off
% August 13
%   computer crashed overnight or early in the morning due to a microphone oscillation
%   good stimulator appeared to be constantly stimulating the left side of the brain at 11am
% August 16
%   11:50am - tweaked template, set high amplitude threshold
%   1:50pm - lowered the amplitude threshold
%   8:45pm - WN on hit above 7132Hz
% August 17
%   11:59am - WN hit above 6972Hz
%           - increased WN catch trials from 0 to 0.1
%           - lowered volume of WN so that notch will work better
% August 18
%   11:55am - WN hit above 6829Hz
%   12:18pm - added new template to reduce late hits
%   5:30 - Is the left stimulator doing anything?
%       switch configuration to 3-4 (from 1-4) ---> 2 is broken
%   6:30 - raise stim rate to 50% (from 20%) to check stim effect before dark
%   9pm - new stim configuration works better
% August 19
%   no new learning - threshold only allows 8% escapes --> WN off 
%       in future, lower catch rate to 0.05, keep WN volume high
% August 21
%   TW unplugged him, fixed the lead around 10am and replugged the bird
% August 22
%   WN on at dawn - hit above 2359 Hz
%   Stim doesn't appear to have an effect
%   lower to 2310Hz at 11:42am
%   No stim effect
%   Switch stim boxes (L<-->R) and stim across 3-4 on left
% August 23
%   11:45pm - hit above 2260Hz
% doesn't learn anymore
% no reversion effect
% August 24
%   5:40pm - hit above 2290Hz
% August 25
%   2:40pm - wn off
%   6pm - probes out
