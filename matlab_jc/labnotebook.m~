            % version starting at 6pm.  If computer doesn't crash, then look online
            % to see if people have reported bugs with the new LabView.  If it does
            % crash, then re-install windows (?).  Check on 2/2/09.

% Week of November 17, 2008
    % LONG TERM: Get Evren to do reprogramming for trial-by-trial analysis
    %            Reprogram it to do two contingencies at the same time
    %            because it will be informative to see if bird shifts AS
    %            precisely as it can (energy minimizing hypothesis) or if
    %            it can shift more precisely.
% November 17, 2008
%   1. started Figure 5 --- overlayed spectrograms, pitch curves, offset hists 
%   GOAL of this figure: is to explain (lab meeting) predictable
%       flexibility at multiple positions in the same note.
%       Wrote Figure5bk50 and Figure5pk37 --- specified instructions to do
%       such graphs.
% 
%   2. JW ordered materials for a new rig system at Cara's desk
%       Crown Amp, DAQ card (inside computer), DAQ cable, DAQ block
%       I found speakers that work which I put inside the new rig at Cara's
%       desk as well as in the Sam Sober room soundbox.
%
%   3. Zebra finch
%       GOAL: take ZF syllables with precise baseline variation and see if
%       they act more like short notes.
%       IMPLEMENTATION: I put a ZF into the Sam Sober room soundbox to screen.
%       Problems with the program here.
%
%   4. Shift more birds LATE in the note
%       GOAL: fill out the right side of figure 1
%       IMPLEMENTATION: I put or92or82 (pvsly screened, great note presumably learned
%       from an adjacent male that was unrelated) into the TW soundbox.
%
%   5. Planned carrot vs. stick experiment
%       Lisberger paper is informative
%       Sabes paper is seminal
%           They have in common - TRIAL-by-TRIAL analysis of learning.
%           I contribute basal ganglia dependent trial-by-trial learning
%
%   6. Note that the crazy pk37 experiment involving highpass wn did not
%   produce interesting results.  Recovery to baseline did occur.
%
%
%   PROBLEMS:
%       What is wrong with the ZF program?  In the wrong AQ position?
%           Actually it appears that the card was dislodged slightly
%           perhaps when I was moving the computer around.  It's possible
%           that this was due to the card not being screwed in.
%       Which ZF is it? 
%           g15w13 - the problem was that hummingbird needs to be running
%           on the cluster computer to access it online
%
%
%   TO DO LIST:
%       1A. Start or92or82 [done 11/18]
%       1B. Screen ZF (name = g15w13) and select new one if necessary
%       1. Redo Figure 3 [done 11/18]
%       2. Sensitivity analysis for Figures 3 and 4  [done 11/18]
%       3. Compare timescales in lesion and baseline Cara and Evren data
%       4. Look at the second note aa AND bb in Tim's Alldata datasets
%       since I have so many of these.



%November 18,2008
%   Fig 3 sensitivity analysis
%   
%   Problem - I accidentally overwrote Alldata - but I think it's fixed now
%
%   Figure 4:
%    %   It may at some point become a good idea to throw in all the
%    %   inactivation runs OR to throw out #4 which wasn't really a good
%    %   inactivation after all.  It also may be a good idea to compare the CVs
%    %   before and after inactivation for long vs. short notes.
%
%   Zebra Finches - screen a few more -- look for longer syllables
%       BUT first check if the note has good short variation!  If so, use
%       that bird.
%   or92or82 - started at 9pm (8pm its time)
%



%November 19,2008
%   Organized all the lesion data/FDirected song data.  All pitch curves were taken at sigma=2
%   for both data sets because that is necessary to do for the low freq
%   harmonics in ZF and because I want to do it in a uniform manner for
%   everything.
%   Cardinal2 now has almost all of Tim's pitch shift raw data birds in one folder.
%           exception being pk32 and pu34 in cardinal3 (not enough space in
%           cardinal 2 to hold these)
%   Cardinal3 now has all the ZF and BF Lesion data in one folder.
%
%   7pm - set up a new ZF (one of Tim's) in the Sober room soundbox.  
%
%   Ran sigma2 on the experiments with successful inactivations so that I
%   can compare.
%


%November 20, 2008
%   Checked or92 - it's shifting well.
%
%   Figure 4 --- see Lesionanaly.m; 1114.m (circa lines 70-90)
%
%   Figure 4 conclusions
%   1. BFs in Inactivation and Lesion Data Sets
%       **correlation between decrease in CV when you shut down AFP and decrease
%       in timescale of fluctuations when you shut down AFP
%   2. ZF baseline vs. BF baseline
%       **As previously observed, timescale is very rapid in ZF baseline,
%       slightly faster than in BF short notes and very consistent
%   3. Directed song
%       **No clear effect on timescale in BFs
%       **Significant broadening of fluctuations in ZFs
%   4. ZF Lesions
%       **Significant BROADENING of fluctuations!!!
%       **opposite of BF lesions; similar to ZF directed song
%       
%  6:40pm - started screening ZF g5o78 - implant from Sam Sober's cage
%

%November 21, 2008
%  Things are looking great with or92
%  ZFs 
%   1. g5o78 (in Sam's box) appears to have much slower fluctuations than
%   the younger birds that Mimi has
%   2. check different notes at different harmonics -- a,b in both g15w13 and g5o78 -- and see if
%   this is consistent for older birds - makes sense - decreased role of
%   LMAN
%   3. make sure (test at diff harmonics) my results in ZF are correct.

%November 23, 2008
% My hunch about the old ZFs was wrong - error caused by having onset way
% to early (700) where all notes looked the same.

%November 24, 2008
% 1. Finished with or92or82 - put data into AlldataFinal1124 #17 as sigma 2
% 2. Switched Tim's birds but have yet to start the contingency
% 3. 

%%% Thanksgiving break

%December 2, 2008
% Set up g5o78 (ZF)
% At 7:30pm, started contingency of ~70% of recent song -- hit below 3700Hz
% I've labeled everything up until the tmptest folder.


% December 4, 2008
% Data Analysis
%   BF Inactivations that decrease CV- Long (6 15 16); Short (10 11)
%   BF Notes in which FD decreases CV - Long (3); Short (2,4)
%   ZF Notes (Lesions, FD) - (1 through 6) (7 is my bird)
% Generally leads to the model that in BFs, decreased CV results from
% decreasing the width of bumps.
%
% Lesion data - days after lesion
%   Mimi's - 7days postlesion for both birds
%   Cara's - 


% December 10, 2008
% Check for oscillations --- may be problems with the amp.

% December 11, 2008
    % Finished g5o78 analysis -- g5o78.mat saved somewhere on cardinal ---
    % I need to transfer it onto the Alldata when I get a chance.
    
    % Started looking at Tim's duet of beatifully inactivated birds that are
    % currently being shifted --- "bk61w42" and "bk61w43"
    
    % Wrote jc_reconstruct which deconstructs two signals into their psds
    % and then reconstructs the autocorrelation which is the difference
    % between the two signals --- purpose is for calculating the shape of
    % the variation contributed by LMAN in Bengalese Finch inactivations.
    % This shape can presumably ultimately be used for simulations.
% TO DO LIST
    % Check birds for food/water -- done
    % Start running my ZF's new note-- bad news
    % Ask about other ZFs
 %%%  %%% % Look at Tim's data
 %%%   % Figure out how to use jc_reconstruct
    % Save g5o78 data

% December 12, 2008
% g5o78 note 'b' --- can't target it precisely
% g15w13 - has a decent note but doesn't sing nearly enough (20 songs per day)

% LEARNING DYNAMICS
% Question 1: Non-directional (fast) component of learning -- what is the
%   contribution of wn escapes when there is no total/gross information
%   encoded by the sum of all wn escapes in a block --- this distinguishes
%   the fast learning/forgetting from any slow processes caused by similar
%   learning from each wn escape.
% Question 2: Slow component and possibly direction component of learning 
% -- contribution of wn escapes when learning is occurring

% Addressing question 1:
% A. Get a large baseline dataset (at least 1000 notes) so that I can look
%   at the baseline distribution of pitches at note n followed by a given
%   pitch at note n-1.  Presumably, the distribution of pitches at note n
%   following an escape will be significantly different AND biased towards
%   the pitch at n-1.
% B. At the 3rd harmonic, run a template that hits ALL the notes.  Set
%   catch note probability at 20%, so that wn blasts 80% of the notes so
%   you get a situation similar to the learning paradigm.  Use a lowpass
%   filtered wn signal so that pitch contours can be extracted reliably
%   from the 3rd harmonic.
% C. Analyze data by comparing distributions of n and n-1 in baseline,
%   hits, and escapes.  It is less necessary to be careful about changing
%   mean in the hit vs. escape comparison.  To account for the changing
%   mean (if present), it may be necessary to measure pitch as deviation
%   from the mean of the preceding 100 notes.

% It is essential to lowpass filter the white noise -- no catch trials
% I have used good amps and speaker to do this reliably.
%   SSober room - volume on crown amp = 57
%   Other room - volume on crown amp = 52
