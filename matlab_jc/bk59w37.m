% LMAN microstim - implanted by Tim during summer 2009
%  July 29, 2010 - screen - on bigbird
%  7.31 - 2:20pm - new templates for STIM and WN
%  8.01 - 10:30am - leads in 
    % - while trying to put them in and get him in the cage, 
    %      he pulled them out twice from flying around, hopefully no damage
% 8.02 - 8:15am - he pulled them out again overnight or at dawn - so we
    % need an alternative solution for him it seems - wax? - also he
    % doesn't like to be perched.
% 8.04 - 
    % probes in around 4:45pm
        % elevated cage to give him space to move around
        % applied bone wax to help keep probes in.
          % questionable - solidifies too quickly - before it can be applied
    
% 8.05
    % plan to test stim when he starts singing a bunch
