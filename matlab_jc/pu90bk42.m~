% decent candidate for syntax learning
% very solid variability, possible to target 

% (A)(B)(C)DEFFFF
% (A)(B)CDEGHI
% (A)(B)CDGHI
% A is rare
% B is about 50/50
% Most common are BCDEFFFF vs. BCDEGHI vs. BCDGHI
% CDEFFFF vs. CDEGHI vs. CDGHI
% Target CDEFFFF vs. CDEGHI

% Seems targetable - should be pretty easy to hit the first F - worth screening
% Also has targetable high stack notes

%  6.1.11 - transferred to launchpad sound box for screening/learning
%  6.2.11 - 5:40pm - changed filter settings - segment at 500
