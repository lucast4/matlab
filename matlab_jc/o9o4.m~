% microstim candidate
% 08.05 - began screening
% 08.07 - wn on at 4:30pm to test

% Doesn't sing much when wn on

% TW surgery ~8.24.10
% first time I put leads in, he didn't sing much

% 9.01 - leads in
% 9.02 - singing
%      - sama made template - okay but not perfect
% 9.03 - singing - ready for stim - start after Labor Day Weekend



% Leads w/o epoxy were used - the lead going to the right side of the brain
% has good connections on wires 2,3,4 but not 1.  The lead going to the
% left side of the brain has good connections on 1,3,4 but not 2.

% 9.07 
    % - 8:30am to 10:30am - stim test with wrong stim wires on right side (R14,L14)
        % - effect was increased noisiness but no deflection in FF
    % - 10:30am to 5:20pm - stim test with correct stim wires (R23, L14)
        % - effect was increased noisiness and a big upward deflection in FF

% 9.08 
    % made new template to increase hit rate
    % changed delay to avoid hitting late in note
    % 5:30pm - stim with new template - 50ms delay, 80ms duration, R23, L14
        % Dramatic and consistent upward deflection and increased noisiness
    % 8:40pm - stim off
    % Goal: find a stim configuration without noisiness
        % Try R24, L14 (other option is R34, L14 --> assumes right side
        % increases the noisiness)
        % Try reducing stim amplitude

% 9.09

% Left stimulator was off until 2:26pm
    % 9:45am - R24, L14 stim
        % caused disruption - the worst I've seen thus far
        % also caused a huge upward deflect
        % This is evidence that acute changes in LMAN activity can lead to the big changes in
        % deafening.
    % 12:20pm - L14 stim (no stim on right side)
        % no effect
    % 1:05pm - R34, L14 stim
        % big effect but not as big at R24
    % 2:00pm - R23, L14 stim
        % test this again
    % 2:26pm - L14 only (no stim on right side, but left stimulator turned on)
        % sufficient to cause minor upward deflection
    % 3:30pm - R23 only (note that we know R24 and R34 are sufficient for large effect)
        % no distortion but 20Hz minor upward deflection
 % SO...L14 and R23 are ideal
    % 5:41pm - test this configuration again
        % based on pvs runs, it looks like noisiness arises from left side
    % 6:06pm - template test for WN
    % 6:12pm - 50microamps L14 and R23
        % 40Hz upward deflection but no noisiness! - perfect
        % adjust to 40ms delay to ensure it is across the entire syllable
    % 8:18pm - decrease stim %age to 20%
    % WN to hit above 2500Hz
  % WN on at 8:50pm
% 9.10
    % no singing with wn on
    % turned stim off at 11am - wait for song to turn stim on
    
% 9.13
    % still no singing - stuck another bird in his cage at 10:50am
    % 12:21pm - wn off - no singing
    % singing
    % new template to hit the stack note on the first trigger
        % template913wn.mat _ although not actually used for wn
    % to do: test stim at 90mA with new template

% 9.14
    % 12:30pm - stim with new template
      % hits too late
    % try 100ms delay and 80ms duration
      % not a great effect until late in C
    % 2:50pm - try 70ms delay and 80ms duration with 70uA
    % 3:38pm - chronic stim on
    % 8:10pm - stim off, new template
        % problem with new template - recognizes calls
        % problem with other templates - occassionally triggers stim during
            % one of the BTAF filters!
% 9.15
    % 1:21pm - stim test
        % looks great - 40Hz upward offset
    % 4:08pm - stim on 100%
% 9.16
    % hitting well (almost perfect)
    % might need to raise non-BT threshold to 2.5
% 9.17
    % pulled out right side lead at some point between 8:30am and 10:10am
    % put it back in at 10:10am
    % still no effect
% 9.18
    % probes pulled out again
    
% 9.22 
    % try stim exp again
    % test effect starting in the late afternoon - 50% catch
% 9.23
    % 11am - 0% catch
