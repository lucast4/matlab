% microstim candidate
% 7.08 (or around then) - made template for STIM - data in on swift8
% 7.31 - plan to do a delayed wn test for 'reinforcement' vs. 'error correction'
    % -- screened in chick, template that recognizes end of flat stack
    % -- difficulty in recognizing stack with high precision due to noisy
        % beginning of the note
% 8.01 - WN test - 100% from 12:05pm to 2pm - making sure delay works
    % 50ms silence, 30ms wn, 50ms silence
    % Looks good, but WN reduces singing rate - hopefully he adapts
    % 8pm - WN on, hit ...
    
% 8.05 - conclude that he doesn't sing enough with WN on to allow rapid
% learning.
