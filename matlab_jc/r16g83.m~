% surgery on 12.17.09 - bilateral RA cannulae implantation using new
    % coordinates - 10 degrees at 0.3mm caudal
% singing in the morning of 12.18.09

% good bird for covert syllable structure
% bad bird for syntax - no transition

% control WN test
% 12.20.09 at 2:15pm - amp on 
%   hit highest 70% of solo high stack note 'a' (below 3360Hz)
% completely stopped singing when wn came on

%  01.11.10 at 4pm - probes in
%  01.12.10 at ~9am - started singing
%  01.13.10 at 11:25am - 4mMapv on at 1.0uL/min
%  01.13.10 at 2:14pm - start hitting first high stack after the long low
%       stacks - hit all above 3240Hz (~40%) to drive pitch down.
%       Didn't sing much
%       9:30pm/lights off - switch to ACSF
%  01.15.10 at 10:40am - 4mMapv on at 1.0uL/min
%           at 12:30pm - hit above 3200Hz to drive pitch down
%  01.16.10 - clog

% white noise attenuation
% 01.19.10 at 9:57am chick time - hit above 3350Hz (I think wn had driven
% it up) --> note that wn is at low volume (level 53)
% 01.19.10 at 4:49pm - hit above 3320Hz
    % CAN'T USE THIS AS CTL BECAUSE LOTS WN started on 1.18.10
% 01.19.10 at lights off - wn off
% 01.20.10 - learned to reduce pitch

% 01.21.10 at 1:22pm - hit above 3305Hz - see if you can drive learning
%          at 2:41pm - all above 3295Hz

% within a small period of time (afternoon)

% 01.25 - at 2:15pm - probes in 
.
    % right side showed a bit of friction despite no apparent clog 

    % began singing late night 1.25
% 1.26 at 6pm - stable, ready to shift on 1.27
% 1.27 at 11am chick time - 4mMapv on at 1.0uL/min
% 1.27 at 1:20pm chick time - WN on - hit above 3330Hz (top 70%)
    %% NOTE %%%% - bird sings different pitch for stack note after a-
% 1.28 
    % Covert shift revealed - 30Hz decrease
    % Note that 127pC is the appropriate data set (morning of 127)
        % Before this, pitch was lower due to lack of stabilization after
        % probe insertion.
        % Note that 
    % 4pm chick time - accidentally switched APV on for 5min at 0.8uL/min
    
% 1.29
    % New experiment (bidir - try to shift C up)
    % 4mMapv on at 10:40am chick time
    % WN on at 12:50pm - hit below 3340Hz
% 1.30
    % NO LEARNING - suggests learning is of absolute position instead of
        % directional bias!!!
% 1.31
    % 12:08pm chick time - 4mMapv on
    % 12:50pm chick time - note A template test
    % 1:30pm - wn on below 3430Hz
    
% 2.01 
    % looks good
% 2.02
    % NOTE C
    % acute effect is up
    % time to test my hypothesis
    % shift up - hit below 3380Hz
    % APV on at 10:15 chick time
    % WN on at 12:15 chick time
    
% 2.03 - turned WN on at noon on 2.03 then off mid-afternoon on 2.03
% 2.04 - planned control shift, WN on at 12:15pm but clog
    % 2.04 - probes out at 3pm

    
% 3.03 - Positive Control  (24hrs - to match pu57 etc)
    % tmptest - 6:30pm - same template as before - cntrng(4).TH=3 instead of 2
% 3.04 - 1:45pm - hit above 3340Hz to drive pitch down (~bottom 40% escape)
% 3.05 - 12:00pm - amp off

% 3.17 - single housed in cold room
