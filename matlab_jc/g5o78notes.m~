% C - 3pm to 8pm


% Experiment 1 - pitch shift at end of long note.  I chose the end of the
% note because it appeared more flexible than the beginning.  I did not
% choose the middle because I wanted to be able to get a good estimate of even a long
% timescale learned bump.
% For FFstats and pitch curve calculations, 
    % I chose the most powerful harmonic (the 5th harmonic),
    % which has a baseline mean of ~3700Hz and std of 45Hz. 
% Initial template (templa1) is the average of the 95th point.
% *cntrng settings have great precision and are near the end of the note but
% before it gets abnormally noisy.

% December 2, 2008
% Baseline days --- December 1 and December 2
% Took ~ 20% of all song after running cleandir4 b/c ZFs sing less.

% 6:20pm - began testing the template with open logic.
% 7:30pm - started bird at 3700Hz

% December 3, 2008
% Bumped up to 3730 Hz - I think the change is due to a circadian trend
% that was evident in baseline song as opposed to learning.  There tends to
% be a decrease in pitch over the course of a day.
% 3750 overnight

% December 4, 2008
% 3775 at 11am
% Adjusted downwards to around 3750 by evening - big circadian trend.
% Shifting is going well.

% December 5, 2008
% 3820 at 11am
% Changed template to templa2 - both new and old - at 11am.
%templa1 - A
% templa2 - B and C

%there is no templa3

% December 8, 2008
% Kept it around 3900Hz for the weekend
% templa4 for B and C

% December 10, 2008 
% 11am - computer HD filled up, so program "crashed" and wn playback
% ceased.


%%%%%%%%%%%%% Experiment 2 ---- on jcharlesE shared folder on launchpad
% note b --> by labeling note 'a' (clean onset amplitude) and going
% backwards using findwnoteJC2

% use the most powerful harmonic == 6th harmonic at ~4800Hz
