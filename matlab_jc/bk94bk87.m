% Tim screening

% Repeat experiment 
% Typically 3 repeats
% Occassionally (5% of the time) only 2 repeats
% Hit the 3rd repeat with WN to increase p(2 repeats)
% 2pm - screened briefly to make sure it works
% WN on at 9pm








% Potential for covert and syntax
% Somewhat small size - health?

% began screening at 7:30pm on 01.25.10
% 1.26 - his light is not on the clock, so I put in a timer
    % presumably he had stopped singing because he was up all night
% transition into either:
    % A (high stack)
    % B-C (two low stacks - first is 'B' and then high stacks - first is 'C')
% 6pm - looks like 50% or close to it
% start template at 6:30 - hits 'B' - refrac=0.3seconds

% 1.27.10
    % 11:20am (50% A, 50% B) - start WN on B
    % 12pm - first informative trials (i.e. singing through)
    % by 6pm - last three hours - 64% A
    
% 1.28
    % checked at ~1:45pm - approximately no learning
    % problem - pitch shift on long stack note pushes it back later
    % 3pm - wn on both long stack notes, turned up wn volume
        % appears that bird is now singing long stack notes more often!!!

% 1.29
    % Success! - 7am to 11am - 88% A, 12% C
    % Now...the question is: How fast can we drive this from baseline?
    
    % 1pm-5pm - 65%
    % Appears to be getting better at getting the wn off the long stack
        % WN off at 5pm - allow recovery and then try targeting the long
        % stack earlier in the note.
% 1.30 
    % New baseline is around 75% C
    
    % Developed a template that Birdtafs off of the branch point at
    % recognizes the first point of the long stack note.  Even with
    % synshifts, there are no false negatives or false positives.
    
    % WN set to start at dawn on 1.31 - how fast can it learn?
% 1.31
    % 79% A, 21% B in catch trials
    % BUT...completely different in non-catch trials??!!
 
% 2.04
    % 2.02, 2.03, 2.04 - stable with 65% B and 35% A
    % Template ready to go
    % Start WN on morning on 2.05 - 9am or so
% 2.05
    % WN on at 8:30am

% 2.09
    % Hit A (high 3000Hz stack) above 3115Hz (highest 70 percent) to drive FF down
    % Targeted ~ point 250
    % WN on at 12:00pm 
    % WN off at nightfall

% 2.10
    % Hit B (long 2000Hz stack) above 2500Hz (highest 70 percent) to drive FF down
    % Targeted ~ point 200:230
    % WN on at 11:28am
    % WN off at nightfall
% 2.11
    % Hit A (high 3000Hz stack) below 3170Hz (lowest 70 percent) to drive
    % FF up
    % Targeted ~ point 250
    % WN on at 12:15pm 
    % WN off at nightfall

% 3.09
    % Hit B (long 2000Hz stack) below 2500Hz to drive FF up
    % WN on at 1:20pm
    % at 2:50pm - made WN below 2510Hz
    % not very convincing...

% 3.17 --- Moved to JC cage in cold room for now...
