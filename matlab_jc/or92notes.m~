% At 6pm, started recording in Tim's unit.
%
% Tuesday, November 18
% Analyzed song before 10am - decided to target at 90% of the way through
% the note in order to shift the end of the note up.  Targeting is very
% precise (sd<5ms) with no significant outliers.
% Started running tmp with ampoff at 1139a.m.
% Baseline isn't perfectly stable - but started running END UP experiment
% at end of day - at 2360Hz.
%
% Wednesday, November 19
% Whoops - I was driving it down instead of up.  Changed this at 11am
% bird's time and reset at 2360Hz. (wn for everything below 2360)  Raised
% it up to 2380Hz immediately.  I also changed cntrng1 from requiring 10 crossings to
% requiring 9 crossings at this time.
% 6:30pm bird's time - left it at 2365Hz overnight.

% Thursday, November 20
% It's rising up - so I changed the contingency up to 2410 by 11:42 bird's
% time.
% Kept it in the 2410s all day.  As of 5pm bird's time, the targeting was
% perfect and it was hitting every note.  For the entire day, the note had
% flattened out (it was originally downward sloping).
%
% Friday, November 21
% Again, a ton of learning happened in the morning. This has been sustained
% throughout the day - set contingency up to 2450 and still only 50% hit rate.
%
% Sunday, November 23
% Looking great - about the same as Friday.  I think the best bet is to
% stop the targeting plot data now but keep trying to shift it upwards to
% see if we can make a really impressive spectrogram!  The template is
% still doing okay - 75/76 and std=6ms.

% Monday, November 24
% Let recover to baseline around 11am bird's time (12pm real time).
% Switched to a new cage.  Over the weekend, the note recovered very
% gradually towards baseline, but on 1123 and 1124am, the note was at its
