function [x,psdvalues]=jcPSD(pitch,fs)
% x gives the period of the sinusoids that make up the signal
    % note that the relationship between period of pitch variability and
    % timescale of pitch variability is unclear
% psdvalues gives the total spectral power at each frequency.  THIS IS NOT
    % THE SPECTRAL DENSITY - it needs to be normalized by frequency to get
    % that.

pitchN=pitch-mean(pitch);
    acorrinstance=xcorr(pitchN);
    L=length(acorrinstance);
    NFFT=2^nextpow2(L);
    % no normalization for bandwidth
    psda=fft(acorrinstance,NFFT);
    psdvalues=2*abs(psda(1:NFFT/2));
    
long=max(size((psdvalues)));
x(1)=100; % DC component
for i=1:long-1
    x(i+1)=2*(1/(fs*(i/long)))*1000;
