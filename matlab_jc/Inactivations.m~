Inactivations

RA - AP5 testing

% RA attempts. January 2009.
% 
% 1. r32pu82 (implanted approx. 1/6)
% Bird sings normally with probe acsf. Then 30mM apV (not properly phed??)
% causes bird to stop singing. Song stays degraded, see r32pu82compar.m, for weeks.
% Probe removed - putting probe back in ~1/27 causes further degradation.
% 
% 
% 2. bk54w13 (implanted approx. 1/13)
% Bird stops singing with probe acsf. Song stays degraded after probe removal, see bk54w13compar.m
% 
% 
% 3. r36pu51. (implanted approx. 1/12) Bad surgery...
% 
% 4. o31bk41. (JC -implanted 1/20)....First morning after acsf in probe, 
% bird very sick-looking. Probes are not functioning correctly. 
% Main tube popped out of liquid switch, indicating possible clog. 
% Trauma caused by leaking acsf, or by physical damage???
%           surgery on 1/20/09 from 11am to 6pm
%           canin - sang 2-4 times on 1/21/09
%           procedure from 5pm to 6pm on 1/21/09 to add more epoxy -
%               accidentally put epoxy in eye and he got really pissed off
%               and stopped singing
%           1/25/09 ~2pm- put female bird in his cage and he resumed singing
%           1/26/09 ~11am - removed bird and he kept singing
%           1/27/09 - dead in the morning

% 5. pu57w52 (JC) --- SEE pu57plot.m
%           /cardinal4/My_birds/Inactivations/pu57w52
%           surgery on 1/29/09 from 11am to 3pm
%               canin 1200microns above really noisy RA
%                       1050microns above shell of RA
%               32degrees (20degrees tilted forward more than normal)
%               2.15microns lateral of caudal y0, 
%               0.51microns caudal of caudal y0
%           
%           segment at 30;5;100;2
%           started singing on 1/30/09 around 8pm - dipper
%           **note did not change its pitch CV after surgery but mean pitch 
%               increased significantly 
%           2.2.09 at 4:30pm - probe in
%           2.3.09 at dawn - started singing - qualitatively same song
%               but downward perturbation in mean pitch
%           2.4.09 at 10:42am - 2mM AP5
%           2.4.09 at 3:03pm - ACSF
%               6pm - data suggests that AP5 caused reversible decreases in
%                   amplitude and repeat number
%           2.5.09 - didn't sing much
%           2.6.09 - singing again in the morning
%           2.6.09 @ 10:04am - back on AP5 at 2mM until ~1:50pm
%           2.6.09 --- this AP5 run decreases variation as expected!!!
%               due to xls-ization or AP5? Check for reversibility.
%               not completely reversed - try higher []=4mM tomorrow
%           2.7.09 --- AP5 from 12pm to 4:14pm
%           2.8.09 --- AP5 from 9:55am to 1pm (comp time)
%           2.9.09 --- AP5 from 9:40am (real time) to 1:15pm
